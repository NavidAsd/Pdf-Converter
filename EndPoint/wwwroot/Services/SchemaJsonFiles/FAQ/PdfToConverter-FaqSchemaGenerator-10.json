    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "JPEG is typically considered to be the best format for storing photographs because it offers a high degree of compression, which results in smaller file sizes. 
PDF, on the other hand, is often used for documents that require a high degree of accuracy, such as business documents. Because PDFs are uncompressed, they can be larger than JPEGs, but they offer a level of protection that can be useful in some situations."
